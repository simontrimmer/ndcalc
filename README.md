ND Calc Overview
================

This is a utility for calculating and counting down exposure times when using neutral density (ND) filters.

Select the starting shutter speed and the intended filter combination from the lists, pressing the start
button will countdown the exposure and reset button will stop the countdown.

The options tab has toggle buttons to control playing the device's default alert sound and activating
vibration when the time is up and enabling the speech functionality.

When speech is enabled the time remaining is read at interesting points - largest time unit changes and
multiples of tens of minutes or seconds when they become significant.

The count during power save will permit the device to switch off the screen and input devices, but will keep
the CPU active. An option is also provided to try and keep the screen on during the countdown.

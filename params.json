{"name":"ndcalc","tagline":"ND filter calculator & timer for Android","body":"## ND Calc Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a utility for calculating and counting down exposure times when using neutral density (ND) filters.\r\n\r\nSelect the starting shutter speed and the intended filter combination from the lists, pressing the start\r\nbutton will countdown the exposure and reset button will stop the countdown.\r\n\r\nThe options tab has toggle buttons to control playing the device's default alert sound and activating\r\nvibration when the time is up and enabling the speech functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen speech is enabled the time remaining is read at interesting points - largest time unit changes and\r\nmultiples of tens of minutes or seconds when they become significant.\r\n\r\nThe count during power save will permit the device to switch off the screen and input devices, but will keep\r\nthe CPU active. An option is also provided to try and keep the screen on during the countdown.\r\n\r\nIn memory of the Tower Bridge dawn shoot December 2013 with Ryan H. and Phil S.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
